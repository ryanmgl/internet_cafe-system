-Navigate to admin page and enter username: admin1 and password: admin1234 to proceed.

-You can track user sessions in the dashboard and register users.

-Going to the user page gives you access to start a session and end when the user wishes to.

-All transactions are recorded in a database as long as the user is registered and the session has ended.
